## Task: Decoding of 3D Imaginary Reach and Grasp Movements from Non-invasive EEG Signals using Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker Neuromorphic Hardware

For the task of decoding the EEG signals a generic multivariate classifier based on a spiking neural network model abstracted from the insect Olfactory system (particular the antenna lobe AL) is used.
The model in this work is solely trained and used on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform which restricts the implementation of the STDP algorithm used for learning [http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/].
